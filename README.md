**Many thanks to them and all my [donors](#donations)üôèüèª** 

This project is a little [HAL9000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HAL_9000) simulator on M5Stack. Use cases ? None ! It's just for fun üòé The challenge was to store 60 small videos directly in Flash memory. Special thanks to [Tobozo](https://twitter.com/TobozoTagada) for his [ESP32-targz](https://github.com/tobozo/ESP32-targz) library. It was a great help, so thank you dude ü§ó

# Usage

Use left and right buttons to adjust brightness. Use the middle button to hear HAL9000.

You can optimize video loading times by using a simple micro SD card formatted in FAT32. After each decompression, the uncompressed video file will be saved on the SD card (in the `/HAL9000` folder). This uncompressed video file will be used for the next time.

# Compilation

First, edit `platformio.ini` file and change `default_envs` target :

- `default_envs = core` for Core, 
- `default_envs = core2` for Core2
- `default_envs = cores3` for Core S3.

You can compile the source code and flash your M5Stack.

Remember to upload the FileSystem Image too (the `/data` folder content videos, images and wav). If you don't know how to upload the FileSystem Image, take a look at this [tutorial](https://www.donskytech.com/how-to-upload-filesystem-image-in-platformio-ide/).
